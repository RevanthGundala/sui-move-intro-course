# Contract Deployment and Hello World Demo

## The Complete Hello World Sample Project

You can find the complete Hello World project in [this directory](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/tree/main/unit-one/example-projects/hello-world). 

## Deploying the Contract

We will use the Sui CLI to deploy the package to the Sui network. You can deploy it to either the Sui devnet, testnet or 
the local node. Just set the Sui CLI to the respective network and have enough tokens to pay for gas. 

The Sui CLI command for deploying the package is the following:

```
sui client publish --path <absolute local path to the Sui Move package> --gas-budget 30000
```

The output should look something like this if the contract was successfully deployed:

![Publish Output](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/main/unit-one/images/publish.png)

The object ID under the `Created Objects` section is the object ID of the Hello World package we just published.

Let's export that to a variable. 

```
export PACKAGE_ID=<package object ID from previous output>
```

## Calling a Method through a Transaction

Next we want to mint a Hello World object by calling the `mint` function in the smart contract we just deployed.

Note that we are able to do this because `mint` is an entry function. 

The command for this using Sui CLI is:

```
sui client call --function mint --module hello-world --package $PACKAGE_ID --gas-budget 3000
```

The console output should look like this if the `mint` function was successfully called, and a Hello World object was created and transferred:

![Mint Output](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/main/unit-one/images/mint.png)

The object ID under the `Created Objects` section of the output is the ID of the Hello World object.

## Viewing the Object with Sui Explorer

Let's use the [Sui Explorer](https://explorer.sui.io/) to view the Hello World object we just created and transferred.

Choose the network you are using through the dropdown menu on the upper right. 

If you are using a local dev node, select the `Custom RPC URL` option and enter:

```
http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

Search for the object ID from the output of the previous transaction and you should be able to find the object on the explorer:

![Explorer Output](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/main/unit-one/images/explorer.png)

You should see the text "Hello World!" under the object's properties. 

Great job, this concludes the first unit of the course.
